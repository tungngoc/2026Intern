Q: Analyze using "cherry-pick" for fix bugs production?
Hotfix testing by ThanhDang: Cherry-picking is well-suited for producing hotfixes because it allows for the precise application of bug fixes without affecting other functionality; however, it requires resynchronization with development to avoid lost fixes and history discrepancies.

Hotfix anylyze by SonNguyen: 
- In hotfix flow, "cherry-pick" is a precise and efficient tool that apply exactly one proven fix to production via a hotfix branch for
deploy fast then merge back to keep history consistent.
- Strategies for using:
    - Use when a bug fix already exists on main or develop but production must stay stable.
    - Apply only small, isolated bug-fix commits.
    - Avoid commits that depend on refactors, schema changes, or breaking changes.
    - Use a dedicated hotfix/* branch created from release/*.
    - After deployment, merge the hotfix back into main and develop to keep branches aligned.

Hotfix anylize by BinhHo, how to use:
I'm working on feature branch, I pushed some commit: 

- commit 1
- commit 2 (commit is picked up to hotfix)

Now, release branch only want to get commit 2 to fix bug from production. 

From release branch we can use cherry-pcik to pick commit what we want. 

Steps:
Step 1: get id of commit 2, example: abcdef.

Step 2: git checkout release-1

Step 3: git **cherry-pick** abcdef 

Step 4: git push 

Step 5: Deploy
