Q: Analyze using "cherry-pick" for fix bugs production?
Hotfix testing by ThanhDang: 
- Cherry-picking is well-suited for producing hotfixes because it allows the precise application of specific bug-fix commits without impacting other features or untested changes. This approach helps reduce deployment risk and speed up production or UAT fixes.
- However, cherry-picking also requires proper resynchronization with the development branch after the hotfix is deployed. Without this step, teams may face lost fixes, duplicate commits, or Git history discrepancies across branches.
My step to use cherry-pick:
- Use cherry-pick for critical, isolated bug fixes only
- Create a hotfix branch from UAT/Production
- Keep commits small and focused
- Cherry-pick back to develop after hotfix

Hotfix anylyze by SonNguyen: 
- In hotfix flow, "cherry-pick" is a precise and efficient tool that apply exactly one proven fix to production via a hotfix branch for
deploy fast then merge back to keep history consistent.
- Strategies for using:
    - Use when a bug fix already exists on main or develop but production must stay stable.
    - Apply only small, isolated bug-fix commits.
    - Avoid commits that depend on refactors, schema changes, or breaking changes.
    - Use a dedicated hotfix/* branch created from release/*.
    - After deployment, merge the hotfix back into main and develop to keep branches aligned.

Hotfix anylize by BinhHo, how to use:
I'm working on feature branch, I pushed some commit: 

- commit 1
- commit 2 (commit is picked up to hotfix)

Now, release branch only want to get commit 2 to fix bug from production. 

From release branch we can use cherry-pcik to pick commit what we want. 

Steps:
Step 1: get id of commit 2, example: abcdef.

Step 2: git checkout release-1

Step 3: git **cherry-pick** abcdef 

Step 4: git push 

Step 5: Deploy
