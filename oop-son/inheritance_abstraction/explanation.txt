Abstraction
- BaseIntegrationTest abstracts the general configuration (start containers, setProperties), hiding the initialization details of
Mongo/Redis from specific tests.
- Helper methods in the test (e.g., createProduct, createValidProductRequest) also abstract the creation of test data.

Inheritance
- BaseIntegrationTest is an abstract class, and the test classes (ProductIntegrationTest, SortFilterIntegrationTest, SearchProductIntegrationTest) all extend BaseIntegrationTest.
- Proof: BaseIntegrationTest provides Testcontainers and DynamicPropertySource initialization, and the test classes inherit that behavior.
